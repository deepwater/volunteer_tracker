Dear Garlic Festival Volunteer:

Weâ€™re sorry. On February 17, you may have received an email for volunteers at a Bay Area art festival. The email was generated through a development server containing data from the Gilroy Garlic Festival. At no time was your email address exposed to any outside group or individual. Your information is secure. Still, it never should have happened and we apologize. 

Corrective action has been taken to eliminate all GGF data from development servers and additional precautions have been taken to make sure the incident is not repeated. We are deeply committed to your privacy and to the growth and prosperity of the Gilroy Garlic Festival. 

Again, we offer you our most sincere apologies and thank you for your patience.

The Volunteer Tracker Development Team
